The Wii is a very good example of a NUI, because it allows users to interact with games by real life motions. Motions like tennis, bowling, boxing etc.  </p>\n<p>A natural user interface is an interface that let people interact with a system and the way they interact with the system comes from their natural behavior. </p>\n<p>As said before an NUI is not necessarily a device, but it is more an action what the user needs to do to perform a specific task on the system. You cannot say that a touchscreen is a NUI, but the interface on the screen is more a NUI, like the swiping motions. </p>\n<p>This report will investigate the usability of four games, Mario Kart, Wii sports, Wii fit and just dance, all games are considered sports games</p>\n<h2>Preface</h2>\n<p>Since today there exists a lot of ways you can interact with a computer, this can be done with mouse and keyboard. But there are plenty of more ways on how to interact with a computer, for instance with a natural user interface(NUI).  </p>\n<p>According to  Techterms a NUI is:  </p>\n<p><i>“An NUI is a type of user interface that is designed to feel as natural as possible to the user. The goal of an NUI is to create seamless interaction between the human and machine, making the interface itself seem to disappear."</i></p>\n<p>This is a very general description of a NUI, but it is more than just a user interface that feels natural. Let\'s first break the term NUI into parts, what is a user interface? A user interface is a graphical representation from where the user can interact with the system. That can be the touchscreen of a mobile phone or the mouse of a computer. It is not necessarily the screen or mouse itself, but rather the icons and buttons you can click on. So, we know what a user interface is, it is not a device but it is a part of system. The user interface can be seen as the bridge between the whole system and the user. Continuing, what does natural mean? Natural means that that it comes originally from nature, things we are already able to do from nature. When we talk about natural behavior, we talk about the things we are used to do in our daily lives. Things like driving, walking, eating biking etc.  </p>\n<p> So, a natural user interface is an interface that let people interact with a system and the way they interact with the system comes from their natural behavior. </p>\n<p>As said before an NUI is not necessarily a device, but it is more an action what the user needs to do to perform a specific task on the system. You cannot say that a touchscreen is a NUI, but the interface on the screen is more a NUI, like the swiping motions. </p>\n<p>This document will focus on one platform, with multiple example applications with at least two NUI’s in it. The platform we chose is the Wii3. The Wii is a platform most people are familiar with. It has a wide range of games that you can play. These games all have certain objectives that the user needs to complete. To complete the objective the user needs to perform specific tasks. These tasks are defined as a natural user interface. Tasks like driving, bowling, boxing etc. As long as the actions performed are similar like the natural human behavior, they can be considered NUI’s.   </p>\n<p>Furthermore, this document will investigate the advantages and disadvantages of a specific NUI and how it improves the usability. This brings us to the following main questions:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the different in character movements in sports games and how are the movements made possible? </li>\n<li>Are there similarities in natural gestures performed with a natural user interface among different sport games?  </li>\n</ul>\n<p> This report will mainly focus on sports games, because doing a sport contains a lot of motions. These motions can all be considered natural behavior, we do not assume that everyone is a professional athlete when talk about the natural movements in sport. It is not the case that you will need to have professional experience to play tennis on the Wii.  </p>\n<p> Another thing this report will investigate is when an interface is considered natural, according to the earlier mentioned definition. The Wii comes with a solution to mimic the real motions performed while doing sports, but how close are these motions to the sports in the real world. How does the Wii make it possible to capture the motions.  </p>\n<p>Before we answer these questions, we will start doing a small desk research about natural user interfaces. After that we will continue picking one game and that will be used for usability testing, using the thinking out loud method. The test will be recorded in a video.  </p>\n<h2>Research</h2>\n<p> In this chapter we will focus on some specific natural user interfaces. Here we look at a couple of applications, games in our cases, that can be controlled with different user interfaces. At the end we will conclude what NUI will feel most natural. In the conclusion it will become clear what NUI to use for which application and what not.  </p>\n<p>We will mainly focus on different natural behaviors in games, such as steering a car, doing different types of sports and other player movements in games. We will not focus on the way the Wii works and the different sensors that make all these motions possible.  </p>\n<p>We will draw the conclusion by testing if the interface feels natural or not. Is there a NUI for the current purpose? What is the current purpose of the NUI? We will mostly look at other usability tests performed by other researchers. The usability test for Wii sport we will perform our self. </p>\n<p><b>How the Wii works</b></p>\n<p>The Wii, as the whole system, consist of three main parts. We have the computer, the Wii itself, which is responsible for processing all the operations. Then we have the sensor bar, the sensor is just made of two infrared (IR) sensors, one on each end.  It is the same technology used in television remotes. The IR-sensors emit light that can be detected by the Wii remote, which contains a camera that can read IR light. The remote uses the sensor as a calibration point for setting the left and right boundaries. The Wii remote doesn’t see your tv when you point at it, it sees the IR sources on the sensor bar and orients itself based on those points. It similar on how ships navigate to the lighthouse or how airplanes orientate their way to the landing strip. </p>\n<p>The Wii remote also contains an accelerometer, which can measure the movements of the remote. The accelerometer measures if the remote is moving back and forth, left to right and up and down. This quite similar with how a smartphone reverses the screen. </p>\n<p>This is the basic concept of how the Wii works, but aren’t we given the sensor bar way to much credit for what it really does. So what happens really inside the sensor bar and do you really need it, or is it possible to replace it with something else. </p>\n<p> Before we continue we will try to make more sense of the sensor bar, as explained in an article from IGN4. Nintendo claimed that the sensor bar was not only a gadget that miraculously interacted with the controller, but that it also transmitted motion data from the Wii remote back to the console itself. But in fact the little senor bar is expandable it doesn’t do what you think it does and you might not even need it. You can even replace it with some household items. </p>\n<p>The Wii remotes accelerometer based motion control can work with or without the sensor bar, this depending on the type of game you are playing. There actually some more problems with the sensor bar from a usability perspective what really decreases the popularity of the Wii by a lot of gamers. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>First thing is that the bar is wired, so you can not place it anywhere in the room. It has to be closed to the Wii, so if you have a large room this can be really annoying. This one reason why you might want to remove or replace the sensor bar.</li>\n<li>The second thing is that the sensor bar emits light the strength of a lighter, it can only be seen by the Wii remote from a 9 feet distance. It is like navigating on the sea at night with a single LED-light. So again if you have a large room this is another reason  why you want to remove or replace the sensor bar. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>So these are the problems some consumers have with the senor bar on the Wii, there are multiple solutions for the problems we encounter. As turned out, you can completely remove the senor bar, there is no data being transferred from the senor bar to the Wii. The only purpose of that wire is to power the sensor bar from electricity, so you can replace the IR source with anything that emits the same sort of light. You can a wireless IR-sensor with batteries in it, or if you are crafty enough build your own. Even more simpler , you can replace the sensor bar by two candles. Candle light gives you even a higher accuracy for the Wii remote, if you want to play from a bigger distance you can use stronger IR sources, there are some stronger wireless IR-sensors on the market.  </p>\n<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x45O829CzNQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p> We will continue exploring the four examples of games for the Wii, all containing some NUI’s. We will investigate what is natural about it and the similarities and differences between other NUI’s. Since that is the goal of the this report.</p>\n<h3>Mario Kart</h3>\n<p>Mario Kart Wii is a racing game with playable characters from the Mario series. The characters must race against each other using a kart. The players can pick up items and use them as speed, defense or crowd control. There are multiple maps/circuits that the player can choose from. </p>\n<p>Mario Kart Wii uses the Wii remote\'s motion sensing, to provide intuitive and conventional steering controls. The Wii Wheel, can be used to control the player. The Wii Wheel will need the Wii Controller placed inside the Wheel. The motion sensor, will be able to detect the steering of the wheel, resulting in the player turning their kart. The Wii Wheel is supposed to make the controls of the car more realistic. In real-life however, you will also need the pedals which the Wheel doesn\'t provide. Instead of using the pedal, the buttons of the Wii remote inside the Wheel can be pressed to give gas.  </p>\n<p><b>Technique</b></p>\n<p>As above is written, the Wii works using three sensors. Two IR-sensors are in the sensor bar and one accelerometer in the Wii remote. The IR-sensor is used to determine the position of the steering wheel, whether the player is moving to the left or to the right. The accelerometer is measuring how fast your are steering, in the game it is also possible to jump with your car. This can be accomplished by moving the Wii remote upwards, this motion is also made possible by the accelerometer.  </p>\n<p><b>Usability</b>  </p>\n<p>For the usability of this game we looked at other people who play this game and listen to their opinions.5 In the video you can see a Youtuber playing Mario Kart for one hour. As you can see he can play most of the race parkours within an hour. He did not start from the beginning, but halfway down.  The game is easy playable without any further instructions on how to steer, since almost everyone know how to steer. Not that you need a driver’s license to play the game, but everyone has seen other people steer. Steering is a very natural behavior, because it is very logical that you have to move left or right.  The thing that is less natural about the game is the way you move forward in the game, there is no pedal. So that is all done with buttons, the user has to learn the correct button combination in order to play the game. This takes a little bit more time than doing something the user is already used to.  </p>\n<h3>Wii sports</h3>\n<p>Wii sports is the game you get for free when purchasing the Wii. It contains a numerous sports games like tennis, bowling, boxing, golfing, baseball, etc. All of these contain multiple natural user interfaces. The games work with a remote controller that tracks motion of the players arm movement. The interface allows the user to perform different type of actions, for tennis the player can move his arm to hit the ball. For every game the movements are based on the players natural behavior, not that the player needs to be professional tennis player to play the game.\nWith as few instructions as possible the player should be able to play the game, because the player doesn’t need to have instructions on how to move his arm. Playing the games will have to feel natural. These are things that come from the players\' natural behavior that the user does not have to relearn. This what makes the interfaces in this application a natural user interface. The main purpose of this game is to make people do more sports, but another question to ask is if this game really makes people do more sport.</p>\n<p><b>Technique </b></p>\n<p>This game is one the examples where you don’t need the sensor bar, because the sensor bar is only there to determine the position of the remote. The Wii doesn’t have to know the position to play Wii sports, this game only needs to know how the remote moves through the air. So the accelerometer is actually enough to play Wii sports, the only thing where you need the sensor bar in this games is to navigate through the menu to pick a game to play.   </p>\n<p><b>Usability</b></p>\n<p>The usability for Wii sport will be tested by ourselves and recorded in a video. We will be using the thinking out loud method when testing the several games and natural user interfaces. The thinking out loud method means that the testers say everything what they think of the different aspects of the system. What does the tester think about? What will he do? How does he think it works in the first place? </p>\n<p>While doing the test, we will also answer the main questions: What are the different character movements in sports games and how does a NUI improve the usability of a sports game?</p>\n<h3>Wii fit</h3>\n<p>Wii fit is an exercising game consisting of activities using the Wii Balance Board, an extra device that comes with the Wii that makes the game controllable with the persons weight. In this game there are a lot of mini games you can play with different types of NUI’s, all the games being pretty similar. All of them require the player to move his body on the balance board, left to right, back and forth.  For example, take the skiing game. The player needs to move his body to control the skier. If you compare it to real skiing it is also pretty similar. The only difference being is you’re not on a hill but on a flat surface. If you compare the player\' movements of the skiing game, then it is very similar with other balance games. There is a game where you have to move a ball on a platform into a hole, the way the player moves on the balance board is the same as player moves the skier.<br>\nFurthermore, the NUI of the balance board is not limited to only moving an object or player back and forth or left to right. There is a way to jump on the board, this not like real life jumping since you have to jump without lifting your feet of the ground. But is another of using the balance board, you also can walk on the board by lifting your legs up in the air at a certain way. This is being used for the rope walking game.<br>\nAs you can see, there are multiple ways of moving an object with your weight. Some are closer to natural behavior than the other. But moving an object with your weight can be considered as a natural user interface. </p>\n<p><b>Technique</b> </p>\n<p>This game works way different compared to the other examples. This game doesn’t require the sensor bar and the Wii remote. (You only need the sensor bar to navigate through the menu.) But this game works with the Wii balance board, a device that measures the weight of the user and how his body is moving on the board. This is done with two weight sensors to the left and right on the balance board (basically just two scales glued together).6 The player has to balance on the two scales to be able to move a character on the screen. </p>\n<p><b>Usability</b> </p>\n<p>Since this game works with an extra device, the usability is different than the other games. Moving a character or object with your body weight seems very natural, but there are some side effects. Since the balance board has to “learn” the users weight every time a new user steps on it, the game can have very poor results when the weight is not set correctly. For example, when a heavier person steps on it, the board is set to that person\'s weight. So moving to the right is a certain percentage of that persons body mass, to make things easy let\'s say 50%. When a lighter person steps on it becomes really hard to move the object left to right, this is because 50% of this persons weight can be 25% of the other persons weight. Causing the balance board to respond less accurate. This mainly is because the weight is set in a player\'s personal Mii character and switching to a new character takes quit a lot of time. Since you have to go back to the main menu and reset the weight if not done so.</p>\n<h3>Just dance</h3>\n<p>Just Dance is a rhythm game where you have to "dance" on the beat. The game consists of a collection of songs, each with different dance routines. Doing so, you have to hold the original Wii controller in your hands. During gameplay, the tv will show dance moves that you have to perform. The controller will detect your movement, giving you points for the accuracy of the movement and if it\'s following the rhythm. Players are given points based on how well they do. </p>\n<p>The natural movement in Just Dance is the dancing part. Dancing is an art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. In the Just Dance game, the game the player will have to perform the dance moves shown on the monitor.</p>\n<p><b>Technique</b></p>\n<p>This game works quite similar to Wii sports, just like in Wii sports you don’t need the sensor bar to play his game. Since the position of the Wii remote is irrelevant to the game, the only things that the game needs to know are the motions made with the Wii remote.  </p>\n<p><b>Usability</b> </p>\n<p>The Wii remote must be held by the right hand. Due to the game only detecting the motions made by the Wii remote, the game can be played with only using the arms. Because of this, the game can be played without dancing, but just with swinging your arms. However, the swinging of the remote must still be done on the rhythm. The Wii remote isn\'t able to detect the motions of the other parts of the body, due to the limitation of the technology.  </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this document was to investigate the different character movements in sports game, with the main focus on the Wii platform and how a natural user interface improves the usability of those games.  </p>\n<p> This is investigated by looking at example applications which contain one or more natural user interfaces in it. The games where Mario Kart, Wii sports, Wii fit and just dance. All the games require to move a character or object on the screen, this can be done in different manners by moving the Wii remote. There are two types of movements that can be performed on the Wii:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>One is by pointing the Wii remote to the sensor bar and so moving a cursor, object or character. This is being accomplished by measuring the position of the remote relative to the sensor bar, with a infrared sensor.  </li>\n<li>The other type of motion is made possible by the accelerometer in the Wii remote itself, this being used when the remote needs move left to right, back and forth and top to bottom.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some games use both the sensor bar and accelerometer, some use only one them. The Mario Kart game uses both, the sensor bar to determine the position of the remote for steering and the accelerometer to jump.  </p>\n<p> Games like Wii sport and Just dance only use the Wii remote since the position of the remote is irrelevant to the game. The only thing what needs to be measured is the motion of the remote, if the user is swinging his hand back to forth to hit a tennis ball in example.  </p>\n<p> The third way we have of moving a player is with an object or character with the balance board, a device used in Wii fit. The balance board is basically two scales glued together and the player can move his character by leaning to left, right, front or back of the board.  </p>\n<p>And last but not least, how does a natural user interface improve the usability of those games? The main benefit of using a natural user interface is that your using something that the user doesn’t have to learn. Motions that come from their natural behavior, like moving your arms, steering a car, leaning left and right etc.  </p>\n<p> So the use of a natural user interface really speeds up the learning process of the game, a way to improve the usability of the Wii is to use a stronger sensor bar. So a stronger IR-source, that will cause for higher accuracy for the position of the Wii remote. </p>',frontmatter:{title:"Usability natural user interfaces in sport games"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/NUI-sports-games/"}}}});
